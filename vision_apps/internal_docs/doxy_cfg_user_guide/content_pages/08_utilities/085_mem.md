# A72 Memory Test {#group_apps_utilities_app_mem}

[TOC]

# Introduction

This application is a quick sanity test for allocating, accessing, and freeing
memory blocks from the contiguous shared memory allocator, running fully on A72 HLOS
(no remote cores are involved in this test).

# Description

This test does the following:

  -# In a loop which iterates 16 times:
      - Allocates 128kB block from the APP_MEM_HEAP_DDR heap (which is the cached, shared memory region in DDR that all cores have access to).
      - Queries and reports the physical address, as well as the file descriptor handle
  -# In a loop which iterates over each of the 16 buffers:
      - Performs various simple read/write accesses
  -# Reports the time duration of the full sum of operations across all buffers (this can be used to get a relative performance delta if this region has the cache turned on or off or reconfigured).
  -# Frees all the buffers.

# Supported plaforms

# Steps to run the application on J7 EVM (Linux + RTOS mode)

-# Build the application and related libraries as mentioned in \ref BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS for Linux+RTOS mode
-# Run the app as shown below
   \code
   cd /opt/vision_apps
   ./vx_app_arm_mem.out
   \endcode
-# Output will be sent to the terminal standard output.

# Steps to run the application on J7 EVM (QNX + RTOS mode)

-# Build the application and related libraries as mentioned in \ref BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS for QNX+RTOS mode
-# Run the app as shown below
   \code
   cd /ti_fs/vision_apps
   ./vx_app_arm_mem.out
   \endcode
-# Output will be sent to the terminal standard output.
