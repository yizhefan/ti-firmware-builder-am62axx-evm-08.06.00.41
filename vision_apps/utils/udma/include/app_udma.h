 * \brief This section contains APIs for UDMA initialization
 *
 *        Few utility APIs to copy/fill frames are implemented in this library
 *        using the UDMA LLD for convenience of application code.
 *
 *        For algorithms it is recommended to use the UDMA LLD APIs directly
 *        or UDMA DMA copy API present in PDK to avoid additional layer of
 *        software overhead.
