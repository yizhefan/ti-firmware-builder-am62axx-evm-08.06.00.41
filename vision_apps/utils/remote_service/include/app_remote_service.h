/**
 * \defgroup group_vision_apps_utils_remote_service Remote Service APIs (TI-RTOS only)
 *
 * \brief These APIs allows user to invoke functions or services on remote cores by abstracting the
 *        low level IPC details.
 *
 *        These APIs are meant to be used for control like functions and not to
 *        execute real-time algorithms.
 *
 *        Also service commands are executed in a single thread so multiple requests
 *        to the same CPU get serialized. Also once a service commands executes it runs to
 *        completion and only then moves on to another service commands.
 *
 *        The focus of these APIs is simplicity rather than low latency, efficiency.
