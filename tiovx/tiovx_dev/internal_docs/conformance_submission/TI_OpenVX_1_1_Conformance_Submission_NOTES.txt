Any special notes about the test results,
=========================================
Laplacian pyramid and Laplacian reconstruct conformance tests 
were modified since we implemented the OpenVX 1.2 version of 
these 2 kernels.  
Without the modifications, the tests would show fail.  
Other modifications were simply environment/platform related changes.
Refer included patch file for exact changes
